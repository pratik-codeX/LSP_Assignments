1)open() System Call

-open() is a low-level system call provided by Linux to request file access from the kernel.

*int open(const char *pathname, int flags);

#Purpose

*Requests the kernel to open a file

*Establishes a connection between the process and the file

*Returns a file descriptor on success

#Flags Used

O_RDONLY → Opens the file in read-only mode

#Return Value
Condition	Return Value
Success		Non-negative integer (file descriptor)
Failure		-1 and sets errno

2)File Descriptor (FD)

-A file descriptor is an integer handle used by the operating system to represent an open file inside a process.

#Important Points

*Managed by the kernel

-Acts as an index into the process’s open file table

-Used by system calls like read(), write(), and close()

#Standard File Descriptors
FD	Meaning
0	Standard Input (stdin)
1	Standard Output (stdout)
2	Standard Error (stderr)

User-opened files usually start from FD = 3.

3) errno — Error Reporting Mechanism

-errno is a global integer variable set by the kernel when a system call fails.

#Key Characteristics

-Only meaningful after a function failure

-Not reset automatically by the system

-Each error corresponds to a symbolic constant (e.g., ENOENT)

#Common Error Codes
Error Code	Meaning
ENOENT		File does not exist
EACCES		Permission denied
Others		OS or filesystem-related errors

4)strerror() — Human-Readable Error Message

-strerror() converts an errno value into a descriptive string.

*char *strerror(int errnum);

Example
strerror(ENOENT);  // "No such file or directory"


-This improves debugging clarity and user understanding.

# Program Flow

-User enters a filename.

-Program attempts to open the file using open() in read-only mode.

-If open() fails:

File descriptor is -1

-errno is checked to determine the cause

-If open() succeeds:

-Kernel assigns a valid file descriptor

-File is ready for further operations

#Execution Scenarios

Case 1: File Exists

open() succeeds

Valid file descriptor is returned

Case 2: File Does Not Exist

open() fails

errno = ENOENT

Case 3: Permission Denied

open() fails

errno = EACCES

#Learning Outcome

-Through this program, we understand:

-How Linux interacts with user processes during file operations

-Why file descriptors are essential for system-level I/O

-How errno acts as a communication bridge between kernel and user space

-The importance of interpreting system call failures correctly

#Conclusion

-This program provides a foundational understanding of Linux file handling at the system-call level.
By using open(), file descriptors, and errno, it demonstrates how operating systems ensure controlled and secure access to files while offering precise error diagnostics.
